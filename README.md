# World_Happiness_Report

Please note, this project was created as part of the 'Advanced Analytics & Dashboard Design' course in the CareerFoundry Data Analyst program.

## Context:
The World Happiness Report is an annual publication that offers a unique perspective on global well-being, going beyond traditional economic measures to assess happiness. It draws upon the Gallup World Poll data and provides a ranking of countries based on their citizens' self-assessed life satisfaction. This report has become a global reference for understanding the factors that contribute to happiness and has sparked international conversations about the importance of well-being in policy-making.
The Gallup World Happiness Report measures happiness and well-being in countries around the world using a range of indicators and questions in their surveys. 

## Goal:
The goal of this project is to analyze World Happiness Report data to contribute to a deeper understanding of global well-being and happiness and to provide interested parties with data-driven insights to facilitate the development of policies that enhance the well-being and quality of life for citizens in our region/country.

## Objective:
To comprehensively study and understand the factors influencing happiness levels at the country and regional levels, identify trends and changes over time, and provide insights into the determinants of happiness for all interested parties.

## Limitations
*Missing Data*: There are gaps in the data for specific countries, which makes it difficult to conduct a continuous analysis for all countries over the specified period. Missing data can introduce bias into analysis.   
*Limited Factors*: The Gallup Happiness Report examines a select set of factors influencing happiness, which may not capture the full spectrum of determinants that vary among individuals and regions worldwide. This limited scope could restrict the depth and comprehensiveness of the analysis.   
*Sample Bias*: The sampling method used by Gallup to collect data may not always be fully representative of the entire population. Sample bias can affect the generalizability of the findings.   
*Data Quality*: Data quality can vary between countries, same as Data collection process, affecting the reliability of comparisons. Some countries may have more robust data collection processes than others.
